Idea: Simulate procedural fire spread by randomly setting flamable cells on fire
-> randomly generated
-> simulate spread with help of cellular automata (consider generations)

Disclosure:

	- The basic algorithms of the cellular automata structure where implemented as shown in the lectures

Bugs:
	- Unfortunately the display function does not display the correct states, even tho the code is correct. 
	Debug.Log shows the correct value, textMesh.text doesn't!
	There seems to be a problem referencing TextMeshes in that case
